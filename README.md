# MACHINE-LEARNING

Personal machine learning library based on the watermelon book from Zhou, and imitate the API of sklearn. If time is adequate, I'll try my best to achieve most of the algorithms in watermelon book.

* ~~logistic regression~~
* ~~decision tree~~
* ~~neural network~~
* ~~svm~~
* bayes -> skip temparary
* ensemble -> now I'm here!
* clustering
